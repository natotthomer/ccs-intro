# Introduction to Programming!

This is a basic roadmap for a few short lessons, introducing kids who have never done any coding before to some of the basic concepts and languages through a couple of practical and, hopefully, interesting projects. This is intended to be an introduction Web Development, through a primer on its 3 core languages:

* HTML => A language that allows us to build structure and sections in web pages, like Headers, Footers, Lists, Paragraphs, etc.
* CSS => A language that allows us to style and make those structure prettier
* Javascript => A language that allows us to add interaction and more involved user input

These three make up just a fraction of the languages and technologies that live on the web, but they
represent the majority of what is regularly used. There is always more to learn!

Assuming this is a roughly 5-day course, I would break things up into the following days:

* Day 1 => HTML basics
  * What is HTML?
  * What is a tag?
  *
